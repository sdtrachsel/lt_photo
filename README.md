The Photo Album Showcase is a React-based application bootstrapped with Create React App, designed for the efficient navigation and display of photos and albums. Users can browse through a catalog of albums, each containing photos categorized by their specific IDs and titles. Selecting an individual photo provides an isolated view for detailed examination. Prioritizing functionality and user interface clarity, this application ensures streamlined interaction and precise data presentation.

### Features
>  - Album Search: The application provides a search allowing users to efficiently locate albums by ID or title. This feature ensures quick navigation to specific albums within the catalog.
>  - Photo Browsing: Within each album, users have access to a comprehensive list of photos, each distinctively labeled with its ID and title, streamlining the exploration process.
>  - Photo Search: For more targeted exploration, users can employ the photo search function, enabling the pinpointing of individual photos based on their ID or title within the selected album.
>  - Isolated Photo View: Upon selecting a specific photo, the application provides an isolated view, ensuring users can examine the photo without distractions.
>  - Deep Linking Capability: The application is designed with deep linking in mind, ensuring that users can directly access specific photo or album pages through their unique URLs. This feature guarantees that each page, when bookmarked or visited directly, will initialize properly, fetching the required data from the API and presenting it consistently, enhancing navigation efficiency and user experience.

## Developement Process  

### Github Project  
A [project board](https://github.com/users/sdtrachsel/projects/6/views/1) guided the application's development. Each task was represented as a 'user story' with accompanying 'acceptance criteria' to ensure user-focused and structured feature development. User stories were further utilized for integration/end to end testing.
